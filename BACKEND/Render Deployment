 Create and Configure a New Web Service on Render
This section guides you through setting up a new Web Service on Render to host your Node.js backend server.

Steps to Create a New Web Service
Access the Render Dashboard:
Log in to Render using your GitHub account.
On the Render Dashboard, click New > Web Service.
Connect Your GitHub Account:
If prompted, authorize Render to access your GitHub account.
This allows Render to pull your repository for deployment.
Select Your Repository:
From the list of repositories, select your repository (e.g., your-username/your-repo).
Ensure you choose the main branch, as this is where your code resides.
Configure the Web Service
Name:
Enter a name for your service, such as ugc-app-backend. This will also be part of your Render URL (e.g., https://ugc-app-backend.onrender.com).
Environment:
Select Node as the environment, since this is a Node.js application.
Region:
Choose a region close to your users for better latency (e.g., Oregon, US West).
Build Command:
Enter npm install. This command installs your project dependencies as defined in package.json.
Start Command:
Enter npm start. This command runs node server.js as specified in the scripts section of your package.json.
Instance Type:
Select the free tier for now to keep costs low during development and testing.
You can upgrade to a paid plan later if you need more resources.
